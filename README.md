# About
This game is a clone of an old iPhone game I used to play called Theseus by Jason Fieldman for the TI-84 Plus. The name is based upon the story "Theseus and the Minotaur". While this is a clone of the older version of the game from 2008 [link](https://www.fieldman.org/theseus) and apparantly he came out with a newer version of it in 2015! [link](https://www.fieldman.org/theseus-plus) and you can see the source code of the original here [link](https://github.com/jmfieldman/Theseus). All of the level designs are from Jason Fieldman's game.
